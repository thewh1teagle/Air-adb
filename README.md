# Air-adb

A new Flutter project.

This is my first app written in flutter

You can easily start adb server on your phone and develop your apps on your mobile phone without a cable!
with this awesome vscode extension it's even more comfortable - https://github.com/alfredobs97/adb-wlan-vscode

## Note: 
root permission on your device is required.
